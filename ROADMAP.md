## Done

### 0.2.0

- **Discover:** search the plugins in the marketplaces already on this computer and add one to
  Claude Code and Codex in one review. Add a marketplace from a folder or a GitHub link.
- **Skills:** copy a skill into a client from Discover, with Undo.
- **Every client the change reaches:** Add and Preview name Cursor when it loads Claude Code's
  plugins and skills.
- **Obot:** register an Obot gateway, see what it holds, connect clients with OAuth, and move
  direct servers into it. "Move all" waits and retries when Obot is busy.
- **MetaMCP:** see what the gateway holds and move direct servers into it with one Apply and one
  Undo.
- **Switch gateways:** move every client to another gateway in one review.
- **Gateway diagram:** a client opens its app, the gateway opens its own page.
- **UX audit fixes:** keyboard focus stays through redraws, every control is at least 24 px,
  success and diff text keep 4.5:1 contrast, a lost Apply or Undo answer is read back, restart
  notes only for changes that happened.
- **New look:** the Kitden house, light and dark Graphite themes, client icons, and calm motion
  that shows what changed.

### 0.1

- One page for Claude Code (with the Claude Desktop Code tab), Codex and Cursor: MCP servers,
  plugins, skills, hooks and marketplaces.
- Things that load twice, each with one fix.
- Turn items on and off with a preview, a backup and Undo.
- Connect clients to a MetaMCP or Obot gateway.
- A read-only "show my setup" MCP server for agents.
- One-line install, a plugin for Claude Code and Codex, and an Add to Cursor link.

## Next

- Copy any command with one click.
- Linux and Windows.

## Later

- A living map: clients → config files → servers, plugins, skills → gateways.
- A shared setup for a small team.
